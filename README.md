**Note: Terminal is a paid plugin now. I charge a fee for a few of the features in this plugin. Most features are still free to use. Actually, I only charge the use of command history feature, the income will be used to support the development of this plugin.**

## Usage

The default key-binding for the UI is empty. But you can set the key-binding in the Logseq shortcuts settings.

You can learn more from the official [documentation](https://www.vipzhicheng.com/logseq-plugin-terminal/)
